[?]. C. For resub: create a function that returns a new list of saving accounts with the changed balance.
To address the feedback "For resub: create a function that returns a new list of saving accounts with the changed balance.", 
I change the function addInterest in the file bank.fsx.
I delete the printfn call inside the addInterest function and instead i pipe the return of the addInterest function into a print
This is because when pimping in fsharp, it simply returns the outcome of the higher order function, in this case it is List.map
List.map returns a new list with the the saving accounts but after interest has been applied.


[?] B. Great reflections - try solving the uneven problem for resub!
