[-] B. The helper function findBalance is not discussed or reflected upon. 
^ Det er i rapporten det skal ændres på.

[?]. C. For resub: create a function that returns a new list of saving accounts with the changed balance.
To address the feedback "For resub: create a function that returns a new list of saving accounts with the changed balance.", 
I change the function addInterest in the file bank.fsx.
I deleted the printfn call inside the addInterest function and instead i pipe the return of the addInterest function into a print
This is because when pimping in fsharp, it simply returns the outcome of the higher order function, in this case it is List.map
List.map returns a new list with the the saving accounts but after interest has been applied.

[?] B. Great reflections - try solving the uneven problem for resub!
To address the feedback "try solving the uneven problem for resub!"
I change the function createPairs in the file groups.fsx.
I add another pattern, in line 3, which checks if the list only contains three elements, it then creates a pair with those three elements.
To handle this I change the output to be a int list list, instead a list of (int * int) tuple.
This is because the (int * int) list can not also contain a group of three.
This means using @ instead of :: in line 4 and using [] instead of ().
