To adress the feedback "MISSING: File Pascal.fsi contains a (human-readable) specification that matches the tests."
    - I changed the specification in the file Pascal.fsi to be more readable.
    - The specification also matches closer with the cases that we test for.

To adress the feedback "MISSING: File Pascal.fsi contains a warning for runtime errors (memory or overflows), or is only defined to some maximum safe number."
    - I changed the specification in the file Pascal.fsi to a max for the functions pascal and pascalNoRec, where the function will run
    - This limit is different because for pascal and pascalNoRec, 10000 and 100000, because the functions encounter runtime errors for different n values.

To address the feedback " You return 0, not really a special value. Consider for resub making this None or NaN :)"
    - I changed the function to return a new type called IntOrError, which returns a Error Invalid Input, when we encounter k > n || n < 0 || k < 0.
    - This means that the functions now return a new type which is either Error of string or a Value of int.
    - I also changed the Pascal.fsi file to match the change in output type.

There is an argument for why the special value is 'good'.

The report makes clear that the purpose of test design is to systematically find test data aimed at showing that the code does not satisfy its specification.
It's very implied but I would like it to be extraordinarily clear.

To address the feedback "MISSING: The test design describes how extreme/boundary values were chosen from each partitition."
    - I changed the Test values in PascalTest.fsx to contain bigger numbers, big negatives and big positive numbers.
    - These now go up to the limit of meaning 10000 and down to -1000000.


[+/-] There are at least three examples uses of each function in MyListExamples.fsx.
But... why not passed and failed? You had done perfectly in Pascal. Why change it here?
