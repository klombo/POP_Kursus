MISSING: File Pascal.fsi contains a (human-readable) specification that matches the tests.

MISSING: File Pascal.fsi contains a warning for runtime errors (memory or overflows), or is only defined to some maximum safe number.

The functions pascal and PascalNoRec returns some special value (preferably int option) for n<0, k<0 or n<k.
You return 0, not really a special value. Consider for resub making this None or NaN :)

There is an argument for why the special value is 'good'.

The report makes clear that the purpose of test design is to systematically find test data aimed at showing that the code does not satisfy its specification.
It's very implied but I would like it to be extraordinarily clear.

MISSING: The test design describes how extreme/boundary values were chosen from each partitition.
I want very big numbers and very very small numbers (big negative numbers)


[+/-] There are at least three examples uses of each function in MyListExamples.fsx.
But... why not passed and failed? You had done perfectly in Pascal. Why change it here?
