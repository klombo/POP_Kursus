# Define a variable of type int and value 0;

# (hint: the mutable variable is increase by one at each iteration)

#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# Define a variable of type int and value 1; 
# write a while loop that prints the value of the mutable variable and increases it by 1 at each iteration until the value of the mutable variable is divisible by 5 
# (i.e., the remainder of the division by 5 is 0 - e.g., the result of 2 % 5  is 2 and the result of the 5%5 is 0).

# Define a mutable variable of type int with the value of your choice; 
# Write a while loop that prints the value of this mutable variable and multiply it by itself until the value of the variable reaches 1000.
# i = 67
